create package: repository
under repository, create class: BookRepository


## Demo 

* In the new `com.pluralsight.bookstore.repository` package 
reate a `BookRepository` transactional repository 
with methods `create(Book book)`, `find(Long id)`, `delete(Long id)`, 
`findAll()` and `countAll()`.

* The `findAll()` method should have a query that selects 
all the book ordered by title `em.createQuery("SELECT b FROM Book b ORDER 
BY b.title DESC", Book.class)`

* The `countAll()` method counts all the books from the database 
with the query `em.createQuery("SELECT COUNT(b) FROM Book b", Long.class)`
