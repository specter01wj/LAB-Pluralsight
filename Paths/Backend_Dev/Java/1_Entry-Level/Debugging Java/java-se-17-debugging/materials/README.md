# Debugging Java SE
This course utilizes examples to illustrate common problems, fixes, tools and techniques. This code is provided if you want to run the examples in your own environment. Some of the code has intentional problems to cause errors for demonstration purposes. Some is illustrative only and not really part of any functioning system, specifically `Samples.java` which was used for some of the slides. 

This is the "final" version which shows the end result of demos.
