As you may recall, we talked about how to pass command line arguments to IntelliJ back in module 7.
If you need a refresher, the following are the steps to do so:
- In IntelliJ choose "Run" then "Edit Configurations..." from the menu
- Locage the "Program arguments" field on the Configurations dialiog
- We'll be running the program in interactive mode so delete any existing text in the "Program arguments" field then add the text "interactive" (do not include the quotes)
- Click OK

With that change, the program should now run in interactive mode when executed within IntelliJ
