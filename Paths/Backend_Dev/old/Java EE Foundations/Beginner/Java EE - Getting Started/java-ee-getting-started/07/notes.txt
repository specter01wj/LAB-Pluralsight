## Demo 

* In the `src/test/java` directory create a `com.pluralsight.bookstore.repository` package with a `BookRepositoryTest` test class. This should test the repository with methods such as shouldGetNoBook, shouldCreateABook, shouldFindTheCreatedBook, shouldGetOneBook, shouldDeleteTheCreatedBook, shouldGetNoMoreBook
* Add the `src/test/resources/META-INF/test-persistence.xml` file for test purpose
* Add the `src/test/resources/arquillian.xml` file for Arquillian test with the `arquillian-wildfly-remote` qualifier
* The `pom.xml` should add the new JUnit and Arquillian dependencies with the following dependency versions:
* * `<version.junit>4.12</version.junit>`
* * `<version.arquillian>1.4.1.Final</version.arquillian>`
* * `<version.arquillian.wildfly>2.1.1.Final</version.arquillian.wildfly>`
* If you now execute the test by running `mvn clean test` the test will fail with a `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused` exception. That's because the Arquillian test tries to deploy the archive on Wildfly and Wildfly is not up and running
* Startup WildFly (with `$WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh`) and run `mvn clean test` again. The Arquillian tests pass
