# Client

## About
The Client communicates with the server and updates the view that the user sees. It is the user-facing code, which is loaded by Chrome.

### Functionality
Provides a simple form and list. Submitting the form communicates with the server (`./../server/server.ts`), gets updated server state, and renders.
