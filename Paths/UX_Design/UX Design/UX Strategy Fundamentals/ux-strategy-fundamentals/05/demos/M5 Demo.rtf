https://youtu.be/Ladxvbbh8Js (Miss Congeniality scene where her teammate calls her with a mission, she sets ups her siren and drives with urgency as if she was about to capture a criminal, it is soon revealed that the mission is to pick up coffee for the whole team. If this clip is no longer available or if you have the chance to find this clip try to get the slightly longer version where she is leaving her house and getting the order over the phone, to give a bit more context to the audience.)\
